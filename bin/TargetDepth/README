What is TargetDepth?
--------------------

TargetDepth is a simple program to extract depth metrics from a BAM or multiple BAMS.
It is designed to provide a more streamlined way to obtain coverage and count metrics than BEDtools.

Installation
============

Building and running TargetDepth from source requires a GNU-like environment with 

1. GCC
2. GNU Make
3. Perl 5.14 or later
4. Boost library. Which can be downloaded at Boost: http://www.boost.org (also available as package libboost-dev for Ubuntu and Debian)

optional:
---------
- it is required to have SAMtools on PATH to obtain the toal number of reads.

CPAN dependencies
-----------------
- Parallel::ForkManager

Usage
=====
TargetDepth can be used in two ways:
------------------------------------

 1. (Recommended) Use the perl targetDepth.pl which provides a useful interface and some nice properties:
	- Multi-core support. Improves up to 4 CPUs.
	- BAMs can be fed by multiple ways:
		option1: introducing input directory. All bam files present will be analyzed.
		option2: Introduce comma-separated bams (-i BAM1,BAM2..).
		option3: Specify bam paths in a text file (one path per line).
	- More compact output files

 2. Use the binary ./TargetDepth. Some limitations are:
	- No multithreading support
	- No input directory option for catching BAM files.
